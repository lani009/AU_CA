\section{Exercise}
Suppose L is regular. Then Pumping Lemma applies.
Let n be the pumping constant. Choose w be any string in L with n left parentheses and n right parentheses.
By Pumping Lemma, w can be factored into $xyz$ such that $|xy| \leq n$, $|y| > 0$ and, for all $i > 0$ $xy^iz \in L$.
Since $|xy| \leq n$ and $|y| > 0$, the string y consists only of left parentheses and has at least one left parentheses.
Consider $i=2$, then $xy^2z = xyyz \notin L$.
Thus the string has to be hold more left parentheses than right parentheses.
As a result, it's unbalanced, then we have obtained contradiction of the assumed regularity of L.
Hence, L is not regular.
